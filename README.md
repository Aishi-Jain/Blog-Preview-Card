## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I improved my skills in creating responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox. I also practiced using CSS custom properties for theming and managing hover states for interactive elements.

Here's a snippet of the CSS code for styling the card:

```css
.hero {
    width: 384px;
    height: 522px;
    background-color: var(--card-bg-color);
    border: 1px solid var(--black-color);
    border-radius: 20px;
    box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px var(--black-color);
    padding: 20px;
    margin: 90px 900px;
    font-family: var(--font);
    gap: 0.75rem;
    line-height: 1.5rem;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to:

- Explore more advanced CSS animations and transitions
- Enhance accessibility features for better user experience
- Integrate JavaScript to add dynamic content and interactivity
